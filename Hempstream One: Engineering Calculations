2. HYDRODYNAMIC CALCULATIONS
2.1 Required Lift Force
Total Weight (W) = Total Mass × g
W = 250 kg × 9.81 m/s²
W = 2,452.5 N ≈ 2,453 N

Required Lift Force = W = 2,453 N

2.2 Foil Area Calculation
Using lift equation: L = ½ρV²SC_L
Where:
L = Lift force (N)
ρ = Water density (kg/m³)
V = Velocity (m/s)
S = Foil area (m²)
C_L = Lift coefficient
At Takeoff (V = 4 m/s, C_L = 1.2 for NACA 4712 at 15°)
2,453 = ½ × 1,025 × 4² × S × 1.2
2,453 = ½ × 1,025 × 16 × S × 1.2
2,453 = 9,840 × S
S = 0.249 m²

Minimum foil area required: 0.25 m²

At Cruise (V = 10.3 m/s, C_L = 0.6 for NACA 4712 at 5°)
2,453 = ½ × 1,025 × 10.3² × S × 0.6
2,453 = ½ × 1,025 × 106.09 × S × 0.6
2,453 = 32,618 × S
S = 0.075 m²

Foil area at cruise: 0.075 m² (surface-piercing reduces wetted area)

Design Foil Area: 1.2 m² total (provides 4.8x safety margin at takeoff)
2.3 Foil Geometry
Main Rear Foil (75% of total lift)
Lift per foil: 1,840 N
Chord length (c): 300 mm = 0.30 m
Span per side (b): 1,000 mm = 1.00 m
Dihedral angle: 45°
Projected span: 1,000 × cos(45°) = 707 mm

Area per side = c × b = 0.30 × 1.00 = 0.30 m²
Total rear foil area = 2 × 0.30 = 0.60 m²

Front Stabilizer Foil (25% of total lift)
Lift per foil: 613 N
Chord length (c): 200 mm = 0.20 m
Span per side (b): 750 mm = 0.75 m
Dihedral angle: 45°
Projected span: 750 × cos(45°) = 530 mm

Area per side = c × b = 0.20 × 0.75 = 0.15 m²
Total front foil area = 2 × 0.15 = 0.30 m²

Total Foil Area: 0.90 m² (3.6x minimum required)
2.4 Aspect Ratio
Main Foil Aspect Ratio (AR)
AR = b² / S
AR = 1.00² / 0.30
AR = 3.33 (moderate aspect ratio, good for strength)

Front Foil Aspect Ratio
AR = 0.75² / 0.15
AR = 3.75


3. DRAG ANALYSIS
3.1 Foil Drag (at cruise speed)
Using drag equation: D = ½ρV²SC_D
Main Foil (C_D ≈ 0.025 for NACA 4712 at 5°)
D_main = ½ × 1,025 × 10.3² × 0.60 × 0.025
D_main = ½ × 1,025 × 106.09 × 0.60 × 0.025
D_main = 81.5 N

Front Foil
D_front = ½ × 1,025 × 10.3² × 0.30 × 0.025
D_front = 40.8 N

Strut Drag (4 struts, 50mm diameter, 800mm length)
Projected area per strut = 0.05 × 0.80 = 0.04 m²
Total strut area = 4 × 0.04 = 0.16 m²
C_D (cylinder) ≈ 0.8

D_struts = ½ × 1,025 × 10.3² × 0.16 × 0.8
D_struts = 69.4 N

Total Drag (foilborne at cruise)
D_total = 81.5 + 40.8 + 69.4 = 191.7 N ≈ 192 N

3.2 Power Requirements
Power at Cruise Speed
Power = Force × Velocity
P = 192 N × 10.3 m/s
P = 1,978 W ≈ 2.0 kW ≈ 2.7 HP (at propeller)

With 70% propeller efficiency:
Engine power required = 2.7 / 0.70 = 3.9 HP

Recommended motor: 5-8 HP electric or gasoline outboard

3.3 Lift-to-Drag Ratio
L/D = 2,453 / 192 = 12.8:1

(Excellent performance, typical hydrofoils achieve 10-20:1)


4. REYNOLDS NUMBER ANALYSIS
4.1 Main Foil Reynolds Number (at cruise)
Re = (V × c) / ν
Re = (10.3 m/s × 0.30 m) / (1.05 × 10⁻⁶ m²/s)
Re = 2.94 × 10⁶

Classification: Turbulent boundary layer
Foil performance: Optimal for NACA 4-series profiles

4.2 Front Foil Reynolds Number
Re = (10.3 × 0.20) / (1.05 × 10⁻⁶)
Re = 1.96 × 10⁶

Classification: Transitional to turbulent
Performance: Good, within design range


5. CAVITATION ANALYSIS
5.1 Cavitation Number
σ = (P_atm + ρgh - P_vapor) / (½ρV²)

Where:
P_atm = 101,325 Pa
ρgh = 1,025 × 9.81 × 0.70 = 7,040 Pa (foil depth)
P_vapor = 2,338 Pa
V = 15.4 m/s (max speed)

σ = (101,325 + 7,040 - 2,338) / (½ × 1,025 × 15.4²)
σ = 106,027 / 121,448
σ = 0.873

Critical: σ < 1.0 indicates cavitation risk at maximum speed

5.2 Cavitation Prevention
Solutions:
Increase operating depth to 900mm:

 ρgh = 1,025 × 9.81 × 0.90 = 9,051 Pa
σ = (101,325 + 9,051 - 2,338) / 121,448
σ = 0.888 (still marginal)


Limit maximum operational speed to 28 knots:

 V = 14.4 m/s
σ = 106,027 / (½ × 1,025 × 14.4²)
σ = 106,027 / 106,099 = 1.00 (acceptable)


Use thicker foil profile (reduces pressure peaks)


Recommendation: Operational limit 28 knots, foil depth 800mm

6. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
6.1 Foil Bending Moment
Main Foil Loading (distributed lift)
Lift per side = 1,840 / 2 = 920 N
Span = 1.00 m
Average load = 920 N/m

Maximum bending moment (cantilever):
M_max = (w × L²) / 2
M_max = (920 × 1.00²) / 2
M_max = 460 N⋅m

6.2 Foil Stress Analysis
Section Modulus (NACA 4712, 300mm chord, 12% thickness)
Thickness = 0.12 × 300 = 36 mm
Average effective depth = 24 mm
Width (perpendicular to load) = 300 mm
Wall thickness = 12 mm (3D print specification)

I = (b × h³) / 12 (simplified rectangular approximation)
I = (300 × 36³) / 12 = 1,166,400 mm⁴ = 1.17 × 10⁻⁶ m⁴

Section modulus Z = I / y
Z = 1.17 × 10⁻⁶ / 0.018 = 6.5 × 10⁻⁵ m³

Bending Stress
σ = M / Z
σ = 460 / (6.5 × 10⁻⁵)
σ = 7.08 × 10⁶ Pa = 7.08 MPa

Material Check (Hemp-PLA composite)
Tensile strength: 35 MPa (15% hemp)
Safety factor = 35 / 7.08 = 4.9:1

RESULT: ACCEPTABLE (target minimum 4:1)

6.3 Strut Analysis
Strut Loading (compressive + bending)
Vertical load per strut = 2,453 / 4 = 613 N
Strut length = 800 mm
Diameter = 50 mm (outer), 38 mm (inner)

Axial stress = F / A
A = π(D² - d²) / 4 = π(50² - 38²) / 4 = 826 mm²
σ_axial = 613 / 826 = 0.74 MPa (negligible)

Critical: Buckling load
P_critical = (π² × E × I) / L²

E (hemp-PLA) = 5,000 MPa
I = π(D⁴ - d⁴) / 64 = 247,000 mm⁴

P_critical = (π² × 5,000 × 247) / 800²
P_critical = 19,000 N

Safety factor = 19,000 / 613 = 31:1

RESULT: EXCELLENT


7. STABILITY CALCULATIONS
7.1 Center of Gravity Location
Component Weights and Positions (from bow):

Hull structure:        80 kg  @ 1,900 mm
Front foil assembly:   12 kg  @ 1,000 mm
Rear foil assembly:    18 kg  @ 2,600 mm
Motor (8HP outboard):  25 kg  @ 3,700 mm
Operator:             120 kg  @ 1,800 mm

Total mass: 255 kg

CG location = Σ(m × x) / Σm
CG = (80×1900 + 12×1000 + 18×2600 + 25×3700 + 120×1800) / 255
CG = (152,000 + 12,000 + 46,800 + 92,500 + 216,000) / 255
CG = 519,300 / 255
CG = 2,036 mm from bow

7.2 Foil Position for Balanced Lift
Rear Foil Position (75% of lift)
Position: 2,600 mm from bow (564 mm aft of CG)
Lift: 1,840 N
Moment arm: 564 mm

Front Foil Position (25% of lift)
Position: 1,000 mm from bow (1,036 mm forward of CG)
Lift: 613 N
Moment arm: 1,036 mm

Moment Balance Check
Rear moment = 1,840 × 0.564 = 1,038 N⋅m (nose-down)
Front moment = 613 × 1.036 = 635 N⋅m (nose-up)

Net moment = 1,038 - 635 = 403 N⋅m (nose-down)

Trim adjustment: Move rear foil forward 200mm OR
                 Increase front foil to 30% lift distribution

REVISED POSITION:
Rear foil: 2,400 mm (364 mm aft of CG)
Front foil: 1,000 mm (1,036 mm forward of CG)

New moments:
Rear: 1,840 × 0.364 = 670 N⋅m
Front: 613 × 1.036 = 635 N⋅m
Net: 35 N⋅m ≈ BALANCED


8. TAKEOFF PERFORMANCE
8.1 Takeoff Speed Calculation
At takeoff, C_L = 1.2, foil area = 0.90 m² (fully submerged)

V_takeoff = √(2W / (ρSC_L))
V_takeoff = √(2 × 2,453 / (1,025 × 0.90 × 1.2))
V_takeoff = √(4,906 / 1,107)
V_takeoff = √4.43
V_takeoff = 2.1 m/s = 4.1 knots

Practical takeoff: 6-8 knots (accounting for dynamic effects)

8.2 Acceleration to Takeoff
Resistance at 4 knots (pre-takeoff)
Hull drag (planing): ~400 N (estimated)
Foil drag (fully submerged): ~50 N
Total resistance: 450 N

With 5 HP motor (3,730 W), prop efficiency 60%:
Available thrust = 3,730 / (2.1 m/s) × 0.60 = 1,066 N

Acceleration = (Thrust - Drag) / Mass
a = (1,066 - 450) / 250 = 2.46 m/s²

Time to takeoff (0 to 2.1 m/s):
t = v / a = 2.1 / 2.46 = 0.85 seconds

Distance = ½at² = ½ × 2.46 × 0.85² = 0.89 m

RESULT: Very rapid takeoff performance
