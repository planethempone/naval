I. Executive Summary

Project Title: The Circumnavigator: Design and Development of the First 3D-Printed, Autonomous Hemp Hydrofoil
Applicant: Hemp Nation One (Naval Division)
Objective: To design, prototype, and build a single-piece, sustainable hydrofoil vessel capable of autonomous, long-range maritime operation.

The Circumnavigator project is the fusion of sustainable architecture, deep tech autonomy, and next-generation naval engineering. We propose building a prototype hydrofoil with a monolithic, single-piece hull constructed from locally sourced Hemp Fiber Reinforced Polymer (HFRP) filament via large-scale 3D printing. This eliminates the structural weaknesses inherent in multi-panel construction, dramatically reduces manufacturing waste, and positions the vessel as the world's most sustainable high-speed naval platform.

The vessel will integrate state-of-the-art sensoring (Lidar, Sonar) and an AI-driven Real-Time Autopilot—the essential technological stack required for the validation goal: a fully autonomous circumnavigation testing its resilience, range, and environmental impact. This project attracts investment due to its low risk in material supply (locally sourced hemp) and high return in validated autonomous maritime technology.



II. Vessel Architecture & Sustainable Manufacturing

The physical design focuses on bio-composite integrity and hydrodynamic efficiency.

2.1 Monolithic Hemp Hull (The 3D Blueprint)

Material: Hemp Fiber Reinforced Polymer (HFRP) Composite Filament. Utilizing highly refined hemp bast fiber blended with a bio-epoxy or recyclable polymer matrix. This material is lightweight, strong, corrosion-resistant, and inherently sequestered carbon during the hemp lifecycle.
Architecture: The hull will be 3D-printed in one single, continuous piece. This revolutionary additive manufacturing approach ensures monolithic structural stability by eliminating seams, joints, and bonding points—the primary areas of failure in traditional composite boat manufacturing.
Foil Design: The hydrofoils themselves will be designed using NACA profiles optimized for high-speed water operation, fabricated from a high-modulus hemp-carbon composite for maximum rigidity and minimal drag. They will be actively controlled to maintain optimal height and stability in dynamic sea states.
Modular Infrastructure: The internal ballast, battery systems, and critical equipment are housed in modular, interchangeable pods. This allows for easy maintenance, rapid swapping of power sources, and adaptation for cargo or extended research payloads.

2.2 Propulsion and Energy

The Circumnavigator will be powered by a quiet, efficient Electric Propulsion System (dual submerged motors) optimized for the high efficiency afforded by the hydrofoil lift.
Energy Generation: A hybrid system combining a high-density, modular Battery Bank (e.g., solid-state or bio-battery technology) with Integrated Solar Panel Arrays on the deck and a retractable Hydro-Generator (Hemp-Composite Propeller) for energy recovery during transit.



III. Technology Stack for Global Autonomy

The core of the vessel's circumnavigation capability relies on redundant, advanced sensing and real-time decision-making systems.
SystemTechnology & ComponentFunction in Global TripReal-Time Autopilot (AI Core)GreenWeaver AI Maritime Module (Adaptive Machine Learning)Course Optimization: Real-time route planning based on predicted weather, ocean currents, and energy consumption, ensuring maximal range and safety. Dynamic Stability: Instantly adjusts foil angle, trim, and pitch to maintain smooth flight above waves.Obstacle AvoidanceLong-Range Lidar (360°) and High-Frequency Sonar (Forward-Looking)Navigation Security: Detects surface objects (debris, small vessels, icebergs) and underwater obstacles (submerged structure, shallow reefs) crucial for safe high-speed operation.Global CommunicationIridium/Starlink Satellite System (Redundant)Remote Monitoring & Control: Provides essential, continuous connectivity for data telemetry, security tracking, and remote emergency intervention from a ground station anywhere in the world.Data IntegrityBlockchain Supply Chain Ledger IntegrationSecurely logs all operational metrics (fuel usage, material stress, location) to the blockchain, providing immutable proof of the vessel's autonomous journey and performance data.



IV. Operational Model and Sustainability Commitment

The project is designed as a direct demonstration of the Symbiotic Blueprint (harmonizing industry, nature, and technology).
Local Sourcing and Circularity: The HFRP filament will be locally sourced from cooperative hemp farms, ensuring materials are traceable and compliant with regenerative agriculture standards. The single-piece 3D printing process reduces material waste by up to 80% compared to traditional layup methods.
Data-Driven Maintenance: The continuous data logging allows for predictive maintenance by anticipating component failure before it occurs, drastically increasing the reliability required for a solo circumnavigation attempt.
Educational Output: The entire process—from design to circumnavigation—will be documented and used for educational modules within the Hemp Nation One DOCS platform, creating Human Capital and furthering the technical expertise of the cooperative's members.



V. Market & Financial Strategy

This R&D project is not a speculative retail venture but a strategic Technology Validation Investment, significantly mitigating risk for funders.
Target Market: High-level R&D Grants (Governments, EU Funds, Climate Initiatives) and Impact Investors seeking validated Blue Economy technology.
Financial Return: The initial investment provides high-value Intellectual Property (IP) in autonomous, high-speed, bio-composite naval architecture, which can be licensed to commercial shipping, defense, and luxury yacht manufacturers.
Risk Mitigation: The low-risk profile is ensured by Diversified Asset Value (IP in AI/Autonomy, IP in HFRP Composites, and the functional prototype vessel itself), providing multiple pathways for return on investment.

We invite visionary partners to invest in The Circumnavigator, transforming the global maritime future, one sustainable flight at a time.
